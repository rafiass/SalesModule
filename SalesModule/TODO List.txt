SalesPCID for broad sales:
	- Mark broad sales (all branches) as pcid = -1
		- when searching for relevant sales search pcid=@pcid OR pcid = -1
	- Add Apply/Cancel buttons
		- work on local DataSet for branches
		- dont apply anything 'till Apply is pressed
		- When Cancel is pressed just close
		- Dont let Zombie-Salse to be created (no PCID associated)

Properties:
	- Split Properties window to 2 ViewModels:
		1. Original Properties window
		2. PCID association:
		- IsBroad checkbox and an Association button to edit
		- On new sale: PCID will be located in the new SalesGroupM
		- On edit sale: the window will show only PropertiesVM (smaller window as well)
			- PCID will be enabled for edit in the Group's management window
	- Move from SalesPropertiesM to SalesGroupM (including DateFrom & DateTo)
	// This is Group property more than a single-sale property

Comments:
	- Explain confusing properties in SalesPropertiesM: InstanceMultiply, RecurrencePerInstance

SalesGroup:
	- Add a boolean property "isDeleted"
		- Add a view option to view those groups
	- Add GroupTitle:
		- Set NULL by default
		- Show single-sale group as the sale's title
		- Add UI to edit in SalesManagement

Sales:
	- Add a boolean property "isDeleted"
		- Add a view option to view those sales (EditGroup view in SalesManagement)

Products groups for sales:
	- Create Kind3-PLU association table

Backward compatibility: (don't implement yet)
	- Support the use of new DB fields on older DBs:
		- If a field does not exists - create it
		- If a table does not exists - create it

Tests:
	- Check correctness - make operational
